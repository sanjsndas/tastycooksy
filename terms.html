                <p class="mb-4">Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. TastyCooksy expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and course of performance.
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">In no event shall TastyCooksy, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. Indemnification</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless TastyCooksy and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password; b) a breach of these Terms; or c) Content posted on the Service. This indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Service.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State, e.g., the State of California, United States], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11. Termination</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service or contact us to request account deletion. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">12. Severability</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Such provision shall be deleted without affecting the remaining provisions herein. We will replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that most closely achieves the intent and economic effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">13. Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by TastyCooksy on the Service, constitute the entire agreement between you and TastyCooksy concerning the Service. They supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and TastyCooksy with respect to the Service. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>

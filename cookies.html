            <p class="text-center text-lg mb-10 max-w-3xl mx-auto">Welcome to TastyCooksy's Cookie Policy! Just like a pinch of salt enhances a recipe, cookies help us enhance your experience on our website. This policy explains what cookies are, how we use them to make your cooking journey faster, fun, and foolproof, and how you can manage your preferences. We believe in transparency, so grab a cup of tea (or your favorite cooking beverage) and let's dive in!</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. What Are Cookies? A Culinary Analogy</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Imagine cookies as tiny digital recipe cards that websites store on your device (like your computer, tablet, or smartphone) when you visit them. These "recipe cards" contain small bits of information that help the website remember things about you or your actions over time. Just as a chef might use a recipe card to remember ingredients and steps for a dish, our website uses cookies to remember your preferences, login status, or items you've viewed. They're essential for making websites work efficiently and for providing a personalized experience. Cookies can be "session cookies" (which are deleted when you close your browser) or "persistent cookies" (which stay on your device for a set period or until you delete them). They can also be "first-party cookies" (set by the website you're visiting) or "third-party cookies" (set by a domain other than the one you're visiting, often for advertising or analytics).</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. How TastyCooksy Uses Cookies: Our Digital Ingredients</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">At TastyCooksy, we use cookies for a variety of purposes, all aimed at improving your experience and making our Service better. Think of them as different ingredients in our digital kitchen, each serving a specific function to create the perfect user experience. We categorize our cookies to help you understand their purpose:</p>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies (The Foundation of Our Recipe)</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">These cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function correctly. Without them, core services like logging into your account, adding recipes to your favorites, or navigating securely wouldn't be possible. They enable basic functionalities and security features of the website. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. They are typically set only in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You cannot opt-out of these cookies as the website would not function properly without them. They are like the flour and water in a bread recipe ‚Äì indispensable.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> User authentication, security, session management, maintaining user state across page requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies that remember your login status, shopping cart contents (if applicable), or your cookie consent preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Mostly session-based, some persistent for remembering consent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.2. Performance and Analytics Cookies (Measuring Our Culinary Success)</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. They allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. For example, they help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. This data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it doesn't directly identify you. It's like a chef tasting their dish to see what works and what could be improved ‚Äì but without knowing who specifically took which bite. This helps us optimize content, identify popular recipes, and ensure our site is running efficiently.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Website performance monitoring, traffic analysis, understanding user behavior, identifying popular content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Analytics cookies (e.g., `_ga`, `_gid`), which track page views, time on site, and referral sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Persistent, typically ranging from a few hours to two years.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.3. Functionality and Preference Cookies (Your Personal Recipe Adjustments)</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. For instance, they can remember your username, language preferences, or region. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly. They're like remembering your preferred spice level or whether you like your potatoes mashed or roasted ‚Äì they make your experience uniquely yours.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Remembering user preferences (e.g., language, region), personalizing content, enabling interactive features (e.g., video playback, chat support).</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies that remember your preferred units of measurement for recipes, or your last search query.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Persistent, typically ranging from a few months to one year.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.4. Targeting and Advertising Cookies (Sharing Our Delicious Creations)</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They work by uniquely identifying your browser and device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. These are like sharing a photo of your perfectly cooked dish ‚Äì they help us reach others who might also enjoy TastyCooksy, based on their interests. They help us show you ads that are more relevant to your interests and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Delivering relevant advertisements, tracking ad campaign performance, building user profiles for targeted marketing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies from Google Ads, Facebook Pixel, or other ad networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Persistent, typically ranging from a few days to one year.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">2.5. Social Media Cookies (Connecting Our Culinary Community)</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools. They are like inviting friends over for a potluck ‚Äì they help you share our delicious recipes and connect with others who love cooking. These cookies facilitate social sharing features and track your interaction with social media content on our site.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enabling social sharing buttons, embedding social media feeds, tracking social media interactions.</li>

                <p class="mb-4">You have the power to control your cookie preferences, just like you control the ingredients in your cooking!

Your choice will be remembered for future visits (via a necessary cookie, of course!). You can revisit your preferences at any time by clicking the "Manage Cookie Preferences" link, usually found in our footer or privacy settings.</p>

If you need more information about a specific third-party cookie, please identify the service or cookie name if possible. We can provide general information about our integration with these services, but for their specific data practices, we will direct you to their respective privacy and cookie policies, as they are the data controllers for their own cookies.

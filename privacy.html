If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to remove that information from our servers. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to use parental control tools to help provide a child-friendly online environment.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. Links to Other Sites</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. These third-party links are provided for your convenience and to offer additional resources. For example, a recipe might link to a specific ingredient supplier or a cooking tool review site. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit, as their practices may differ significantly from ours. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by TastyCooksy of the site or any association with its operators.</p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will also let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service (e.g., a banner on the homepage), prior to the change becoming effective and update the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy.</p>
